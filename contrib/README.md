# Contributed CLBOSS Utilities

## Installing

There are two ways to install the requirements:
- poetry
- nix

### Poetry
There are two ways to install poetry:
- pipx
- official installer

#### Pipx

```
# Install pipx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx install poetry
```

#### [Or, click here for the official installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

Once poetry is installed, install the Python dependencies:

```
# The following commands need to be run as the user who will be running
# the clboss utility commands (connecting to the CLN RPC port)

# Install clboss contrib utilities
poetry shell
poetry install
```

### Nix
If you have nix, you can just do, from the project root:
```
nix-shell contrib-shell.nix
```

Then before running the commands below, be sure to do:

```
cd contrib/
```

## Running

```
./clboss-earnings-history

./clboss-recent-earnings

./clboss-routing-stats

./clboss-forwarding-stats

./recently-closed

./cln-plugin-bounce <plugin-name>...

The `clboss-routing-stats` and `clboss-forwarding-stats` scripts now accept `--days` to limit
how many days of earnings history are considered when ranking channels.

```

### Script Details

- **`clboss-earnings-history`** now supports additional options:
  - `--csv-file <file>` writes the raw earnings data as CSV.
  - `--graph-file <file>` generates a PNG plot of net earnings.
  - `--bucket` lets you aggregate by `day`, `week`, `fortnight`, `month`, or `quarter`.
- **`clboss-forwarding-stats`** summarizes channel forwarding data and can be
  restricted with `--days`.
- **`clboss-routing-stats`** ranks peers using recent earnings data and also
  accepts the `--days` option.
- **`recently-closed`** lists channels that closed within the last N days, also
  controlled via `--days`.
- **`cln-plugin-bounce`** stops and restarts running plugins without
  restarting `lightningd`.  `plugin stop` needs a plugin's exact
  registered name, which for versioned installs includes the version
  string; the script looks each one up from `plugin list`, stops the
  named plugins in the order given, and starts them again in reverse
  order, so the list order encodes any shutdown dependency between
  them.  Restarts use the unversioned sibling path when one exists
  (usually a symlink maintained by the install script), so a repointed
  symlink brings up the new version.  Plugin names are the arguments
  not starting with `-`; every other argument is passed to
  `lightning-cli` (e.g. `--signet --lightning-dir=...`), so names and
  options may appear in any order.  Plain POSIX sh plus `jq`, so unlike
  a shell alias it also works under `sudo`.
- **`fee-log-parser`** is a parser that streams DEBUG-level logging and writes
  a sqlite database containing fee algorithm information. CLBOSS now records
  the same schema in its internal database (`data.clboss`, tables
  `feemon_peers` and `feemon_change_events`) during normal operation.
- **`clboss-feemon-history`** is a CLBOSS command that returns per-peer fee modifier
  history between optional `since`/`before` timestamps.
- **`clboss-feemon-peers`** is a CLBOSS command that returns peer nodeids with fee
  monitor history between optional `since`/`before` timestamps.
- **`feemon-validate`** compares `fee-log-parser` sqlite history against
  `clboss-feemon-history` per peer over a requested time window. It reports
  per-peer progress, prints compact timestamp diagnostics for missing/extra
  records, prints full-record diagnostics for field mismatches, and exits
  non-zero when discrepancies are found. Default external DB path is
  `./clboss-fee-info.sqlite3` and default timestamp tolerance is 60 seconds.
  Default float tolerance is `1e-5` and is scaled by value magnitude
  (`tol * max(1, |a|, |b|)`) to avoid false mismatches from JSON float
  rendering precision (notably `mult_product`).
  Derived integer fields `est_base` and `est_ppm` use a relative tolerance
  with default `1e-3` (`--int-rel-tolerance`) so small rounding effects at
  large magnitudes do not trigger mismatches.
  `--since`/`--before` accept Unix epoch seconds in addition to the existing
  human-readable time formats. Naive timestamps are interpreted in local time;
  Unix epoch input is UTC; explicit timezone offsets are honored.
- **`plot-fees`** plots fee-related time series for a peer from merged fee monitor
  data: API history (`clboss-feemon-history`) plus legacy sqlite history
  (`fee-log-parser`). When both sources cover a period, API records are
  preferred and sqlite is used only for earlier history. By default it uses API
  data only; pass `--db` to include legacy sqlite history. `--peer` accepts a
  nodeid, alias (via lightning-cli/listnodes), or SCID (via
  lightning-cli/listpeerchannels). The combo view includes a daily earnings
  panel (incoming/outgoing msat per day) when lightning-cli is available, and
  the `incoming-earnings`/`outgoing-earnings` views render those panels on
  their own. In the `theory` panel, a `theory_center` line is drawn only where
  API records include `price_center`; legacy-only spans omit that line. Use
  `--title` to override the plot title (defaults to the peer label; pass empty
  to omit).
- **`plot-aggregate`** plots aggregate percentile summaries from merged fee monitor
  data (API preferred over overlapping legacy sqlite history). By default it
  uses API data only; pass `--db` to include legacy sqlite history. Views include
  `baseline-base`, `baseline-ppm`, `size`, `balance`, `theory`,
  `advertised-base`, `advertised-ppm`, `earnings`, and a `combo` view. Each
  view shows daily
  p00/p10/p25/p50/p75/p90/p100 percentiles across nodes. The `earnings`
  view uses `clboss-earnings-history all` to compute net earnings
  percentiles (sat/day). In API mode, peer discovery uses
  `clboss-feemon-peers [since] [before]` so windowed aggregate plots include
  peers that were active during the selected period (even if currently closed).
