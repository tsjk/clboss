## Earlier writing

ZmnSCPxj, CLBOSS's original author, published a six-part design
series in 2022 at <https://zmnscpxj.github.io/clboss/index.html>:
the overall architecture, inbound liquidity via swaps, connection
handling, and channel candidate investigation, selection, and
creation.  The architecture part still describes CLBOSS.  The swap
and candidate parts predate the `askrene` migration and the
track-record ranking, and the rebalancing they refer to was
replaced in 0.17.0.
