# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Upgrading from 0.16.x

- Core Lightning **v26.04 or later** (v25.09 is the hard floor; see
  Changed below).
- Install the [`xrebalance`](https://github.com/ksedgwic/xrebalance)
  plugin, **v0.4.5 or later**, and load it alongside CLBOSS -- see
  "The xrebalance plugin" under Installing in the README.  Without it
  CLBOSS runs everything except rebalancing.
- Remove `clboss-max-rebalance-fee-ppm` from your configuration;
  `lightningd` refuses to start on an unknown option.
- If you ran a development build from between 0.16.x and this
  release, remove the persistent `askrene` layers it created,
  `clboss` and `clboss-xrebalance`.  This release uses only the
  `clboss-self` layer, and the old layers' node disables and channel
  updates never age out (`askrene-age` trims only constraints and
  biases), so `lightningd` would keep them indefinitely.  They only
  affect routes CLBOSS asks for itself, so removing them is safe at
  any time:

      lightning-cli askrene-remove-layer clboss
      lightning-cli askrene-remove-layer clboss-xrebalance

  `lightning-cli askrene-listlayers` shows which layers exist.
  Release builds of 0.16.x created no layers.
- Nothing else to set: the new options need no settings to start,
  and their defaults are the values run on live nodes.

### Added

- A new rebalancer, **xrebalance**: circular rebalances planned from
  each peer's earnings record and executed through the external
  [`xrebalance`](https://github.com/ksedgwic/xrebalance) plugin on
  CLN's `askrene` min-cost-flow router.  Cycles run on a Poisson
  clock and are also triggered on demand when a forward drains a
  channel.  Pricing is strict by default: a cycle's fee budget
  derives from what the involved peers actually earn, tunable with
  the `clboss-xrebalance-*` options (see README).  Select with
  `clboss-rebalance-mode=<xrebalance|off>`; without the plugin
  loaded, CLBOSS idles with a log hint.

- Channel-open candidates are now ranked by their earnings **track
  record**: nodes whose previous channels earned well ("keepers")
  are funded first, unknowns next, proven underperformers last;
  within the no-record tier, peers advertising splicing are
  preferred (opt out with
  `clboss-candidate-prefer-spliceable=false`).  The new
  `clboss-track-record` command shows the verdict for any node, and
  the `clboss-candidate-*` options tune the judgment.

- Many options are now **dynamic**: settable at runtime with
  `lightning-cli setconfig`, no restart needed.  Each option's README
  entry says whether it is dynamic.  Invalid setconfig values are
  rejected with a proper error instead of being silently ignored.

- `contrib/clboss-xrebalance-view` shows the rebalancer's view of the
  node: each channel's band and its peer's net earnings rates, the
  fill and drain pools, the derived floor ladder, and the `xrebalance`
  request the widest cycle would send, as a dry-run command line.
  `contrib/cln-plugin-bounce` restarts named dynamic plugins in
  dependency order and picks up config-file edits; it applies the
  edits only after checking, against the restarted plugins, that
  every config-file option is still registered, since an option a
  new build dropped leaves `lightningd` holding a stale configvar
  that makes any optioned `plugin start` or `setconfig` crash it
  until it restarts.
  `contrib/clboss-forwarding-stats --ids` prints full node ids in
  place of aliases.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: CLBOSS now requires **Core Lightning v25.09 or
  later**, and **v26.04 or later** is the tested floor.  The probing
  subsystems build routes from the `getroutes` per-hop out-side
  fields (`node_id_out` / `amount_out_msat` / `cltv_out`): on v26.06
  and later these are read directly, and on older versions they are
  derived from the deprecated per-hop fields, which carry the same
  values one hop over.  At startup, CLN older than v25.09 is refused
  before any on-disk state is created or modified, because
  `getroutes` gained `maxparts` in v25.09 and CLBOSS passes it on
  every call (note: with `important-plugin`, a refused start stops
  lightningd itself); versions from v25.09 up to v26.04 start with a
  warning that the version is untested.  Operators running an older
  CLN that carries backports of what CLBOSS needs (askrene
  `getroutes` with `maxparts`, `xpay`) can bypass the refusal with
  `--clboss-skip-cln-version-check`.  Users on older CLN releases
  should stay on CLBOSS 0.16.x, which uses the legacy
  `getroute`/`pay` APIs that older CLN still provides.

- Channel-candidate capacity probing (the Dowser) is one `askrene`
  `getroutes` flow estimate, replacing the loop of `getroute` and
  `listchannels` calls.  The estimate is capped at
  `clboss-max-channel`, the largest channel CLBOSS would open; sizing
  between `clboss-min-channel` and `clboss-max-channel` is otherwise
  unchanged.

- Swap-out invoices are paid with `xpay` instead of the deprecated
  `pay`.  The fee cap stays at 0.5% of the amount, passed as an
  absolute `maxfee`.

- Probes exclude our own node through a persistent `askrene` layer
  named `clboss-self`, which holds only our node id; it shows in
  `askrene-listlayers` and needs no maintenance.

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: the built-in rebalancer (`JitRebalancer`,
  `EarningsRebalancer`, `InitialRebalancer`, `FundsMover`), the
  manual `clboss-movefunds` command, and the
  `clboss-earnings-rebalancer` debug trigger.  Rebalancing is now
  done by the xrebalance engine, selected with the new
  `clboss-rebalance-mode` option.  The `clboss-max-rebalance-fee-ppm` option is removed with
  it; configs still setting it must drop it or `lightningd` will
  refuse to start.
  JIT (just-in-time) rebalancing is removed deliberately: holding an
  incoming HTLC while a rebalance runs delays the whole payment path.
  The demand it served is covered by demand-triggered rebalance
  cycles, which react to observed forwards without holding HTLCs.

### Fixed

- When the channel-candidate table exceeds its cap, the hourly
  eviction now drops the most expendable candidate -- proven
  underperformers first, then no-record candidates (preferring to
  keep those advertising splice support), keepers last -- instead
  of a uniformly random victim that could cost a proven earner
  while underperformers stayed.

- Channel size options that violate the channel-creation planner's
  sizing requirement (`max-channel >= 3 * min-channel + 20000`
  satoshis) no longer crash CLBOSS on the first creation run after
  startup (#147).  The maximum is kept, since it sets typical open
  size, and the minimum is lowered to the largest fitting value,
  with a warning logged.  The creator also now skips a creation
  cycle with a log line, instead of aborting, if onchain funds
  drop below twice the minimum channel size between the decider's
  trigger and planning (#137).

- `contrib/recently-closed` accepts `--lightning-dir` and the network
  flags like the other contrib scripts; its broken import and
  `lookup_alias` call are fixed (it could not run before).

- The `XRebalancer: transfer ...` log line reported `0 part(s)` (or
  `0/0 parts`), no pending note, and no closest failure with
  xrebalance plugin v0.4.4 or later, which returns the per-part
  arrays only on request.  The line now reads the plugin's `summary`
  object -- part counts, the amount still settling, and the closest
  miss -- and falls back to the parts arrays for older responses
  (#338).

- Rebalance parts and forwards through a channel younger than the
  last ten-minute `listpeerchannels` snapshot went unattributed: the
  scid-to-peer table did not know the channel yet, and an unknown
  end dropped the whole part.  The table now learns a channel from
  CLN's `channel_state_changed` notification as soon as it carries a
  short channel id, and a part with one end still unknown is
  attributed to the end that is known (#337).

## [0.16.3] - 2026-08-18: "Tougher Than the Race"

### Security

- Fixed sibling-swap corruption in the Boltz reverse-swap claim path:
  the UPDATE persisting a successful claim had no WHERE clause, so it
  stamped every in-flight swap row as claimed and blocked sibling
  swaps at the "Already broadcasted claim tx." early exit. The update
  is now scoped to the claimed swap. Present since the file's first
  commit (2020); affected funds were recoverable after the timelock,
  no theft path. Reported by Vincenzo Palazzo. ([#325])

- Fixed a fee-budget race in `JitRebalancer`: every incoming forward
  HTLC spawned a concurrent rebalance with no per-destination guard,
  so several in-flight HTLCs toward the same depleted channel
  launched that many full-size rebalances against a stale
  expenditure budget — fees paid on each, and the recorded
  overspend then blocked legitimate JIT rebalances for that channel.
  An in-flight guard now admits one rebalance per destination at a
  time. Reported by Moin. ([#323])

- Fixed auto-close (experimental, opt-in) force-closing offline
  peers: `close` was issued with a 180-second unilateral timeout
  regardless of the peer's connection state, while one complaint
  source selects peers specifically for a low connect rate. Closes
  now wait for the peer to come online (polled every 10 minutes) and
  fall back to a unilateral close at low feerates only after a
  persisted 3-day patience window. Reported by Moin. ([#324])

## [0.16.2] - 2026-08-11: "Leak of Faith"

### Security

- Fixed a theft vector in `FundsMover` self-payments: the returning
  HTLC was settled by matching only payment hash and payment secret,
  without checking the amount. The last-hop peer relays our onion
  (and thus the secret) intact but chooses the offered amount, so it
  could settle a reduced amount, learn the preimage, and claim the
  full amount upstream. The claim now requires the exact constructed
  amount before the preimage is released. ([#322])

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-06: "The Types That Bind"

### Fixed

- Fixed "Unhandled exception in concurrent task! Incorrect type." on
  newer CLN: the `channel_state_changed` notification for a brand-new
  channel no longer carries `old_state` (deprecated in CLN v25.05,
  absent as of v26.06), which crashed the parse in
  `ChannelCreateDestroyMonitor`. ([#321])
- Fixed `newaddr` handling for modern CLN, which no longer returns
  bech32 addresses by default: the address request now asks for p2tr.
  Previously the first swap attempt threw the same "Incorrect type."
  and silently disabled clboss-initiated swaps until restart. ([#321])

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-21: "Darkness on the Edge of the Mempool"

### Added

- **Internal**:
  - Fee Monitor module records per-channel fee-setting context and
    statistics into SQLite (`feemon_peers`, `feemon_change_events`
    tables). ([#296])
  - C++20 coroutine support for cleaner async code. ([#272])
- **RPC**:
  - `clboss-feemon-history`: returns per-peer fee modifier history
    (baseline, size/balance/price multipliers, earnings). ([#296])
  - `clboss-feemon-peers`: returns peer node IDs with fee monitor data,
    with optional time window filtering. ([#296])
  - `clboss-earnings-history`: added "all" (by-node) aggregation mode.
    ([#292])
- **Contrib scripts**:
  - `fee-log-parser`: parses DEBUG-level logs into SQLite. ([#291])
  - `plot-fees`: plots per-peer fee time series. ([#291])
  - `plot-aggregate`: plots aggregate percentile summaries across
    peers. ([#291])
  - `plot-balance-price`, `plot-size-balance`, `plot-size-price`: fee
    modifier analysis visualizations. ([#295])
  - `feemon-validate`: validates fee monitor data integrity. ([#296])
- **Build**:
  - `install-versioned` Makefile target for fast roll-forward/roll-back.
    ([#289])
  - Code coverage reporting in CI. ([#283])
  - Clang C++20 build job in CI. ([#307])
  - Nix flake packaging improvements. ([#285])

### Changed

- `InvoicePayer` now uses CLN's native `decode` RPC instead of manual
  parsing. ([#301])

### Fixed

- `fundpsbt` deprecated integer argument handling. ([#288])
- `Initiator` module handles both old and new `listconfigs` RPC output
  formats. ([#300])
- Backtrace capture disabled under valgrind to fix `make check`
  failures. ([#279])
- Fixed duplicate earnings report sections in README. ([#277])
- Fixed outdated `setchannelfee` reference to `setchannel` in README.
  ([#290])
- Replaced deprecated `std::result_of` with `std::invoke_result_t` for
  C++20 compatibility (fixes build on FreeBSD 14+ / clang 18). ([#305])
- Added missing `#include <cstdint>` for clang strict mode. ([#307])
- Added `-lexecinfo` for FreeBSD in `configure.ac`. ([#307])
- Fixed uninitialized `ReservoirSampler::wsum` warning at `-O2`.
- Fixed crash on non-SRV DNS records (e.g. SOA) in `parse_dig_srv()`;
  removed defunct DNS seeds `lseed.bitcoinstats.com` and
  `lseed.darosior.ninja`. ([#309])

## [0.15.1] - 2025-10-07: "Dancing in the Dark Liquidity"

### Fixed

- Fixed the release build CI workflow

## [0.15.0] - 2025-10-07: "Dancing in the Dark Liquidity"

### Added

- **RPC**:
  - Added the `clboss-feerates` command to report percentile thresholds,
    last observed feerate (perkw), and the current low/high judgment.
- **Configuration**:
  - Added `--clboss-min-nodes-to-process` to control how many nodes
    CLBOSS must know before proposing channels. Defaults: 800 (Bitcoin),
    100 (Testnet), 10 (other). Setting `-1` uses network-specific defaults.
  - Added `--clboss-max-rebalance-fee-ppm` to cap the fee for a single
    internal rebalance (honored by both JitRebalancer and
    EarningsRebalancer). Default is 1000 ppm (0.1%).
- **Contrib scripts**:
  - New `clboss-forwarding-stats` script.
  - New `recently-closed` helper.
  - New `sys_stats_report` to generate heartbeat status reports and
    append metrics (e.g., `utxo_msat`, `avail_msat`, `current_msat`,
    `avail_out`, `utxo_amount`) to a `STATS` file; includes a baseline
    checksum and appends fee data from `clboss-feerates`.
  - `clboss-earnings-history`: added `--csv-file`, `--graph-file` and
    `--bucket` (day|week|fortnight|month|quarter); estimates the last
    bucket based on remaining time.
  - `clboss-routing-stats`: added `--days` to limit the time window.
- **Docs**:
  - Updated diagrams (rebalancer flow, channel balancing orientation) and
    README/contrib docs; refreshed dependencies for contrib tooling.

### Changed

- Reduced the default `--clboss-max-rebalance-fee-ppm` from 5000 ppm
  (0.5%) to 1000 ppm (0.1%).

### Fixed

- `ChannelFinderByPopularity`: ignore our own node when sampling and
  enumerating peers ([#266]).
- Swaps: avoid blank addresses in the cache and clean any that slipped
  in; validate the initial Boltz claim destination address.

## [0.14.1] - 2024-12-05: "Hand at the Grindstone"

### Added

- **Contrib Script Enhancements**:
  - Added `--lightning-dir` option to the contrib scripts:
    - `clboss-earnings-history`
    - `clboss-recent-earnings`
    - `clboss-routing-stats`

    This allows users with non-default configurations to specify their
    `lightning-dir` when running these scripts. ([#243])

  - **Nix Support**:
    - Introduced `contrib-shell.nix` to facilitate running contrib
      scripts within Nix environments. Users can now execute
      `nix-shell contrib-shell.nix` and run any Python scripts in
      `contrib/`. ([#241])
    - Updated `contrib/README.md` with detailed instructions for
      Python dependencies installation, including a section on using
      Nix.

- **Stack Unwinding Support**:
  - Implemented `libunwind` for stack unwinding. This replaces the use
    of `backtrace()`, which is not available on Alpine Linux. This
    improves compatibility with Alpine and other systems lacking
    `backtrace()`. ([#245], [#249])
  - Replaced the use of `program_invocation_name` (only available on
    Linux) with a custom global variable to store the program name,
    improving portability to systems like FreeBSD and other Unix-like
    systems. ([#242])

- **Configurable Exception Backtrace Support**:
  - Added the `--disable-exception-backtrace` option to
    `configure`. This allows disabling the inclusion of backtrace
    information in exception wrappers. ([#256])
  - The `Util::BacktraceException` class now provides a no-op wrapper
    when exception backtraces are disabled via
    `--disable-exception-backtrace`. This ensures minimal overhead in
    configurations where backtraces are not needed. ([#256])

### Fixed

- **Build System**:
  - Fixed issues when building CLBOSS as a git submodule. ([#247], [#250])
  - Improved diagnostic messages for missing `commit_hash.h` in
    tarball builds. This helps users identify and resolve build issues
    when `commit_hash.h` is not present. ([#244]), [#251])

## [0.14.0] - 2024-09-25: "Hand at the Grindstone"

### Added

- **EarningsTracker Upgrade**: Upgraded `EarningsTracker` to a time
  bucket schema, allowing storage and access to earnings and
  expenditure data over specific time ranges. This prepares for future
  enhancements in balancing strategies based on time-based data. Note
  that this update includes automatic database schema changes;
  downgrading to previous versions will require manual database
  migration.

- **Exception Backtraces**: Added `Util::BacktraceException` which
  captures backtraces where an exception is thrown and then formats
  them for debugging when they are displayed with `what()`.  The
  backtraces are more useful if the following configuration is used:
  `./configure CXXFLAGS="-g -Og"` but this results in larger, less
  optimized binaries.

- **New Scripts in Contrib**:
  - `clboss-routing-stats`: A script that summarizes routing
    performance of channels, displaying PeerID, SCID, and Alias. It
    sorts channels by net fees (income - expenses), success per day,
    and age.
  - `clboss-earnings-history` and `clboss-recent-earnings`: Scripts to
    display historical and recent earnings.

  - Added `contrib/README.md` to provide information about the scripts
    and tools available in the `contrib` directory.
  - Introduced a Poetry project to manage Python dependencies in `contrib`.

- **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
  - Added `get_now()` and `mock_get_now()` functions to
    `EarningsTracker` and its tests to support time-based
    functionalities.
  - Implemented `Either::operator<<` and `Jsmn::Object::operator==` to
    facilitate debugging and writing test cases.
  - Factored `parse_json` into a `Jsmn::Object` static method to
    simplify test case generation using literal JSON.

### Changed

- **Build System**:
  - Updated `configure` to use the C++17 standard, fixing compilation
    issues on platforms like Raspiblitz.
  - Improved `commit_hash.h` dependencies and generation to ensure
    correct regeneration when the development tree is modified.

- **Contrib Script Enhancements**:
  - Generalized network parameter handling in `clboss-routing-stats`
    to support multiple networks.
  - Updated `clboss-routing-stats` to utilize an alias cache for
    better performance.

### Fixed

- **Testing**:
  - Increased the timeout for `jsmn/test_performance` tests to prevent
    premature failures during testing.

- **Logging Improvements**:
  - Inserted exception `what()` values into logging messages to
    enhance debugging output and provide more detailed error
    information.

- **Miscellaneous**:
  - Resolved issues with the regeneration of `commit_hash.h` when the
    development tree is altered by Git operations.

### Added

## [0.13.3] - 2024-08-09: "Blinded by the Light"

This point release fixes an important bug by restoring the earned fee
information in CLBOSS.

### Added

- The version string is now logged on startup and in the
  `clboss-status` output ([#205]).
- Added an earnings_tracker diagram.

### Fixed

- The `ForwardFeeMonitor` (and subsequently the `EarningsTracker`) have
  restored ability see fee income ([#222], [#223]).
- A possible vector out of bounds access was removed ([#219]).
- Added totals to clboss-status offchain_earnings_tracker ([#223]).

## [0.13.2] - 2024-07-18: "Bwahaha's Dominion"

### Added

- Added `signet` support ([#148]).
- Updated the seeds list ([#208], 
- Added module diagrams for channel creation, offchain to onchain
  swaps, and channel balancing ([#200], [#203]).

### Changed

- testnet: Reduce the `min_nodes_to_process` because testnet is shrinking ([#209]).
- Improve listpeers handling diagnostics ([#214], [#215]).
- Improve Initialization of OnchainFeeMonitor with Conservative
  Synthetic History ([#210]).

### Fixed

- Converted deprecated listpeer usage to listpeerchannels ([#213], [#198]).
- Recognize `--developer` CLI flag and don't exit giving usage ([#185], [#216])).

## [0.13.1] - 2024-04-16: "E Street Fix"

### Fixed

- CLN `v24.02` deprecated the RPC `msatoshi` fields which needed to be
  converted to `amount_msat` instead.  This caused channel candidates
  to not be found ([#189]) (and maybe other problems).  Fixed in
  ([#190]).
- CLN `v24.02` deprecated the RPC `private` field in the channel info
  RPC data because private channels are no longer present.  Remove
  references to the field because we only want to skip these channels
  anyway.  Fixes ([192])

### Changed

- The minimum number of network nodes seen before initiating certain
  actions is 800 in the bitcoin network.  ([#173]) changes this
  threshold for the testnet (300) and other networks (10).  The new
  thresholds should allow CLBOSS to act when there are fewer available
  nodes.  The bitcoin limit remains 800.

## [0.13] - 2023-09-08: "Born to Run"

### Added

- Continuous Integration (CI) for pull requests!
- Support string "id" fields in the plugin interface.
- Enable SQLITE3 extended error codes.

### Changed

- Disable compiling debug information by default; if you need this,
  explicitly include `-g` in your `configure` command, like so:
  `./configure CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g"`.  This reduces binary size by 20x.
- Avoid parameters/commands deprecated in Core Lightning 0.11.0.

### Fixed

- Can now handle JSON-RPC amounts in either the old convention
  (string, "msat" suffix) or the post 23.05 convention (json number). ([#157], [#164])
- Fixed non-integer blockheights (testnet) ([#170])
- Upgraded libraries and compiler to fix build. ([#169])


## Prior `ChangeLog` entries [formatting change]

- Support string "id" fields in the plugin interface.
- Disable compiling debug information by default; if you need this, explicitly include `-g` in your `configure` command, like so: `./configure CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g"`.  This reduces binary size by 20x.
- Enable SQLITE3 extended error codes.
- Avoid parameters/commands deprecated in Core Lightning 0.11.0.

0.13A
- Disable `InitialRebalancer`, as it is not based on economic rationality.
- You can now disable rebalancing to or from specific peers by using `clboss-unmanage` with the key `balance`.
- Use a single giant `listchannels` call in `FeeModderBySize`.  This should now make CLBOSS usable on nodes with >100 channels.
- Limit the number of concurrent RPC calls we make, to prevent overloading the poor Core Lightning daemon.
- Make `PeerCompetitorFeeMonitor::Surveyor` more efficient by using a new parameter for `listchannels` that was introduced in C-Lightning 0.10.1.  Fall back to the old inefficient algo if the C-Lightning node is < 0.10.1.

0.12 Not Completely Useless
0.11E
- Fix a bug which *removed* `--clboss-min-onchain` instead of adding `--clboss-min-channel` and `--clboss-max-channel`.  LOL.

0.11D
- We now check dowsed channel sizes during preinvestigation and investigation as well, making sure the minimum channel size is respected.
- Add `--clboss-min-channel` and `--clboss-max-channel` settings.
- Make sure `ChannelFinderByPopularity` becomes aggressive at least once, to handle the case where the node was previously (poorly?) managed by a human and might not have good liquidity to the network.
- If our total funds is increased by +25% or more, have `ChannelFinderByPopularity` become more aggressive.
- Support `--clboss-zerobasefee=<require|allow|disallow>`.
- Fix incompatibility with C-Lightning 0.11.x by explicitly using "style": "tlv" instead of "legacy".
- Record offchain-to-onchain swaps, accessible via new `clboss-swaps` command.

0.11C
- Disable `ChannelComplainerByLowSuccessPerDay` for now.
- Adjust our judgment of "low onchain fee" downward (i.e. cheaper) slightly, from 25% +/-5% to 20% +/-3%.
- `ActiveProber` now only does a 2-hop probe always.
- `ChannelComplainerByLowSuccessPerDay` logs a little more on debug prints.
- Tweak parameters for auto-close slightly, being more lenient.
- Fix FreeBSD compile.

0.11B
- `ActiveProber` now also has a background cleaner of its payments.
- `ChannelCreationDecider` now holds off on creating channels if the onchain amount is small relative to all your funds and is small for a "large" channel (~0.16777215 BTC).  This should prevent CLBOSS from making lots of 10mBTC channels when your node is well-funded.
- CLBOSS can now close bad channels.  Enable this ***EXPERIMENTAL*** feature by passing `--clboss-auto-close=true` option to `lightningd`.  If enabled, the `clboss-unmanage` command can disable this for particular peers using the `close` key.
- Remove `libsodium` library, instead use SHA256 implementation from Bitcoin and our own code for basic securtiy issues.
- Add `clboss-unmanage` command to suppress certain aspects of auto-management.
- Fix `InitialRebalancer` bug (introduced in 0.11A) which completely disables it instead of throttling it.

0.11A
- Make `FundsMover` much less willing to pay extra for more private randomized routes.
- New `EarningsRebalancer` is now the primary rebalancer to replace the role of `InitialRebalancer` in previous releases; it will base its rebalancing decisions on earnings of each channel.
- `InitialRebalancer` will now limit how much it will spend on rebalances, as it is intended for the *initial* rebalancing of new channels.
- `FundsMover` is now more parsimonious about its fee budget when it splits moved funding attempts.
- Avoid making multiple channels to nodes with the same IP bin.
- Fix MacOS compile.
- Use `dig -v` to check for `dig` install, instead of `dig localhost`, as the latter may trigger a "real" lookup that will inevitably fail.

0.10 Made of Explodium
0.9A
- Avoid `DELETE ... ORDER BY`, which might not be enabled on the SQLITE3 available on some systems.
- Fix a roundoff error with command `id`s, which would lead to `clboss` eventually crashing after a few days or weeks.

0.8 Facepalm of Doom
0.7D
- Fix latent `printf`-formatting bugs in `SendpayResultMonitor`, which would crash on 32-bit systems.

0.7C
- `FundsMover` now deletes its failing payments immediately instead of letting them languish in your db until the cleanup process gets to them.

0.7B
- Ensure `InitialRebalancer` does not put the destination node at the edge of triggering `InitialRebalancer` again in the next cycle, which was causing multiple rebalances in sequence.
- New option `--clboss-min-onchain=<satoshi>` to indicate how much to leave onchain; defaults to 30000 satoshi, which is suggested to leave onchain in preparation for anchor commitments, but you can leave more (or less) now.
- Document `clboss-status` and `clboss-externpay` commands.
- New commands `clboss-ignore-onchain` and `clboss-notice-onchain` let you temporarily manage onchain funds manually.
- Change onchain fee judgment to use percentile based on the previous 2 weeks of feerates.
- Support MacOS compilation, also checked FreeBSD compilation still works.
- Correct calculation of spendable vs receivable in `NodeBalanceSwapper`.

0.7A
- Properly consider direction of flow when estimating capacities of nodes.
- Properly rebalance channels greater than 42.94mBTC payment limit.
- Use `payment_secret` in rebalances.
- Work around a timing bug in Tor SOCKS5 implementation.
- CLBOSS can now be started and stopped with the `lightningd` `plugin` command.
- Do not use `proxy` if `always-use-proxy` is not `true`.
- New `ChannelFinderByEarnedFee` module proposes peers of our most lucrative peers, to improve alternate routes to popular destinations.

0.6 Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!
0.5E
- Remove busy-wait loop in `FeeModderBySize`.

0.5D
- Tone down `FundsMover` payment cleanup.
- Batch up RPC socket response parsing.

0.5C
- `FundsMover` now has a backup process to clean up its payments.
- `ChannelFinderByListpays` now ignores self-payments instead of possibly proposing self.
- Optimize traversing JSON results for channel finders.
- Reduce processing load when printing really long RPC logs.
- Correctly handle sudden death of `lightningd` process.
- Really, do not delay response to `init`, for reals.

0.5B
- Do not delay response to `init`.

0.5A
- Handle `rpc_command` specially for better RPC response times even when CLBOSS is busy.
- Make compilable on FreeBSD.
- Print more debug logs for internet connection monitoring.
- Limit resources used by rebalancing attempts.
- Long-running processes (channel finders, peer fee competitor measuring) now print progress reports.
- Lowered execution priority of RPC socket reading and parsing, hopefully this will make us more responsive to our hooks.

0.4 Failed a Spot Check
0.3B
- `ChannelFinderByPopularity` now reduces its participation instead of not participating if we have many channels already.
- Channel finders now ensure they only run once even if multiple triggers occur while they are running.

0.3A
- Fixed missing initializations and some checks.
- Fixed build errors in Debian.
