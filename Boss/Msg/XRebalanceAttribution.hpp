/** struct Boss::Msg::XRebalanceAttribution
 *
 * @brief Per-part earnings attribution from a successful
 * rebalance sendpay part.
 *
 * Raised by Boss::Mod::XRebalancePartMonitor once per successfully
 * completed part, from the external xrebalance plugin's
 * xrebalance_part notifications.  Boss::Mod::EarningsTracker
 * subscribes and applies a symmetric DB update: source peer gets
 * `in_expenditures += fee_spent` / `in_rebalanced += amount_moved`,
 * destination peer gets the matching `out_*` increments.
 *
 * Attribution is per part because a single rebalance invocation
 * can use a SET of source / dest scids and have askrene's MCF
 * split the flow across multiple (source, dest) pairs.  Each
 * successful part identifies its actual (source_peer, dest_peer)
 * from the askrene route (first hop's node_id_out and the closing
 * hop's node_id_in).
 *
 * Either peer may be null when the scid on that end did not
 * resolve to one of our channels; the tracker then books only the
 * other side.  At least one side is always set.
